    Maduakolam Onyewu
I’m a computer science major interested in learning about computational geometry. 
I’m a cheerleader for Syracuse, I like to read in my spare time, my favorite book is The Magic Thief, 
I’m the youngest of three children (all boys), and I played the flute for seven years.
I'm interested in learning languages (both spoken and programming).
